Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the driver to retrieve information about
    the guids being registered.

    Implementations of this routine may be in paged memory

Arguments:

    DeviceObject is the device whose registration information is needed

    *RegFlags returns with a set of flags that describe all of the guids being
        registered for this device. If the device wants enable and disable
        collection callbacks before receiving queries for the registered
        guids then it should return the WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE flag. Also the
        returned flags may specify WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO in which case
        the instance name is determined from the PDO associated with the
        device object. Note that the PDO must have an associated devnode. If
        WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO is not set then Name must return a unique
        name for the device. These flags are ORed into the flags specified
        by the GUIDREGINFO for each guid.

    InstanceName returns with the instance name for the guids if
        WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO is not set in the returned *RegFlags. The
        caller will call ExFreePool with the buffer returned.

    *RegistryPath returns with the registry path of the driver. This is
        required

    *MofResourceName returns with the name of the MOF resource attached to
        the binary file. If the driver does not have a mof resource attached
        then this can be returned as NULL.

    *Pdo returns with the device object for the PDO associated with this
        device if the WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO flag is retured in
        *RegFlags.
